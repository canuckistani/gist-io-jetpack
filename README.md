# Gist.IO

A stupid-simple page-mod-based add-on that add's a 'gist.io' link to whatever gist you're viewing. Integrates with Gist.IO, because I might actually use it and I f$#king hate bookmarklets.

Todo:
* detect if we're on a gist at all - DONE.
* detect if the current gist is actually markdown? And do the right thing - PUNTING for now.
