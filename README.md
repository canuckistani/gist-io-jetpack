# Gist.IO

A stupid-simple page-mod-based add-on that add's a 'gist.io' link to whatever gist you're viewing. Integrates with Gist.IO, because I might actually use it and I f$#king hate bookmarklets.

Todo:
* ~~detect if we're on a gist at all~~ - DONE.
* ~~detect if the current gist is actually markdown? And do the right thing~~ - PUNTING for now.
* ~~write user docs~~ DONE
* map the hotKey to go *back* to the gist from gist.io? 

User documentation:

1. browse to a markdown gist
2. click on 'Gist.io' or hit CMD/Ctrl+z
3. Boosh!
